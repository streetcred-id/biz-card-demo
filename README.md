# Trinsic's Issuer Reference App
This demo shows how to add Trinsic Credentials API calls into a nodejs app with our service client.
It also shows a webhook implementation can create automated workflows in your app. 

## Use Case
In this simple use case, you control a (very simple) issuer portal for your organization, which can issue a business card to anyone with a mobile wallet in your organization.
Once a business card is issued, that holder can do business card verifications to other peers using the Trinsic Wallet app.
